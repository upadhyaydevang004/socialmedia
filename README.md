Secured Social Media Website - "Kaleidoscope"


Social Media is a platform through which connecting to
people all around the world becomes easier. These social
websites require personal information like name, date of
birth, email address and some activities like favorite sport,
music, hobby etc. Therefore, securing all this personal
information is very important. Leakage of private data can 
be very harmful to the users as well as people who are con-
nected to them. Private information leakage deals with the 
details about an individual that are not specifically stated,
but, rather are inferred from other details or relationships
who may express that detail. Since security is major concern manipulation on social websites like Facebook and Twit-
ter is not possible. Therefore a new social media platform, Kaleidoscope is developed to carry out various techniques
and experiments with their output.

Kaleidoscope is similar to any other social media, just
a little condensed and less featured. A person can sign up,
create an account and login to the website. Once logged
in, users can perform various activities. A user can send 
messages to other members of the website, edit their pro-
file information, post information on the timeline as well as comment and reply on the various posts.
